# Torch From Scratch

## Overview
"Torch From Scratch" is an educational project aimed at implementing the core functionalities of a deep learning library using only NumPy. This project is inspired by PyTorch, one of the leading deep learning frameworks. The implementation covers basic tensor operations, automatic differentiation, and simple neural network modules from scratch.

## Features
- Basic tensor operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and matrix multiplication.
- Automatic differentiation to facilitate gradient descent.
- Neural network modules: linear layers and various activation functions (Sigmoid, Tanh, ReLU).
- Example implementations of linear regression and logistic regression models.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
